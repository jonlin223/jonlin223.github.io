# I Listened to the Billboard Year-End 100 of 2023 So You Don’t Have To

# Introduction

---

How does one define the 100 most popular songs in a given year? The obvious answer is just looking at the charts, but that ignores a lot of surrounding context. Charts can be flawed. Billboard, the magazine that runs the US charts, for example, have strange definitions of a year; their years change in start dates and length. What about the music that is on that list? The Billboard Year-End chart consistently sees music that crosses over years. Can we really consider such older music to be one of the biggest tracks of a given year? Then there’s Christmas music. We’ll get to that later. Unfortunately, what we have is what we have and so, to expand my musical horizons and improve my very poor writing skills I have decided to write about every song on the Billboard Year-End 100 of 2023. So let’s go, I am about to listen to the Billboard Year-End 100 of 2023 so you don’t have to. Starting from #100…

# #100: “Watermelon Moonshine” - Lainey Wilson

---

{% include youtube.html id="_3jv0_wGK1M" %}

Jumping right into a pool that’s out of my depth… As this the Billboard charts cover the United States, we are going to have to talk about Country Music. A lot of it. Like probably too much. Thankfully, we start with a sound that I’m pretty comfortable with; this sort of chill sound definitely has similarities to some of the singer-songwriter stuff I listen to. Honestly, I dig this quite a bit. Lainey Wilson sings nostalgically about her first love, comparing its highs with the buzz of the “watermelon moonshine” that accompanied it. She’s a great singer, combining a powerful vocal presence with a credible feeling of wistfulness. If anything, I think it might be the production that lets her down here. The instrumentation seems a bit overpowering and while it sounds nice, I think it could dial down a bit in cultivating the nostalgic vibe the song is going for. Still, this is a good start, **7/10**.

# #99: “Bloody Mary” - Lady Gaga

---

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VFwmKL5OL-Q](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VFwmKL5OL-Q)

So funny thing, I was listening to my Spotify mix while doing my write-up for the previous song when I looked over and saw that this song was next on that queue. You can probably figure out from there that I think this song is great. Now I should probably mention how this song is from Lady Gaga’s 2011 album “Born This Way” and was revitalised late last year after a sped-up version went viral on TikTok, featuring Jenna Ortega as Wednesday Addams dancing. This is the first example from this year’s list of what we will call WTF TikTok, where old songs are risen from the dead using TikTok’s necromantic powers. Apart from that, I don’t really know what else to say here. It’s early 2010s Lady Gaga electropop. The hook is crazy good and the production doesn’t sound like ass unlike some other “Born This Way” tracks (I’m looking at you title track). Honestly, I get why this song blew up due to an association with the Addams Family. There’s a lot of gothic bombast going on that backs up the religious tones in the lyrics. As I said, this is great so **9/10**.

# #98: “Put It on da Floor Again” - Latto feat. Cardi B

---

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WtNCR3EDS4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WtNCR3EDS4)

With this song, we are approaching a second pool that is even more out of my depth… Hip-Hop. The problem here is that I’m naturally going to not get a lot of the vernacular and references used, meaning I’m definitely going to miss a lot of what is going on. Having said that, I don’t think this one is too difficult to decipher. Latto and Cardi B go through a pretty basic flex on the haters routine with lines like “They thought I was gon’ fall off, I hate to bring you bad news” and “Put your bestie in a pack and now I’m smokin’ her too”. My thoughts on this song are therefore going to boil down to the question of how much does this pop off? The answer is yes. This pops off. Latto even pauses in the middle of her verse to tell the audience to be quiet and let her pop off. This song continues our strong start to the list. It’s a **7/10**.

# #97: “Meltdown” - Travis Scott feat. Drake

---

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuKm4L9ryB0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuKm4L9ryB0)

Yeah that streak of good music ends here because this one’s pretty bad. This song reminds me a lot of “SICKO MODE”, a previous Travis Scott and Drake collaboration, with its multiple parts. Unfortunately that is where the comparison ends. “SICKO MODE” is filled with memorable hooks and each part feels distinct. Meanwhile, “Meltdown” feels thoroughly beige. I wanted to make a joke about this song being a Chernobyl level meltdown but honestly even that gives this song too much credit. At least nuclear meltdowns are interesting. I thought these sort of diss tracks were at least supposed to be fun. The only enjoyable moments for me came at the song’s expense. For example, lyrics like “the weapons we got are some terrorist shit” and “my dick just got hard cause a wire just hit” left me thinking “WTF are you talking about Drake?” Meanwhile, the Star Wars esque laser sound effects in Travis Scott’s verse made me chuckle. To quote Drake himself, “Heard your new joint, it’s embarrassing shit”. It’s a **3/10**.

# #96: “Bzrp Music Sessions, Vol. 53” - Bizarrap & Shakira

---

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CocEMWdc7Ck](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CocEMWdc7Ck)

Here is where we encounter yet another blind spot. This time less to do with genre and more to do with language. I don’t speak Spanish. Since there will be a lot of Spanish-language songs later in this list, I should probably make the disclaimer now that a lot is probably going to be lost in translation. Sorry. Anyways, I should probably start by addressing the rather strange song title. For those who don’t know, Bizarrap is an Argentinian DJ whose most notable output is a series of collaborations with various Latin artists called Bzrp Music Sessions. In this particular session, he teams up with Shakira to produce a diss track aimed at Shakira’s ex, footballer Gerard Piqué. Unlike many of the later Spanish-language songs we will encounter, this one is a straight up synthpop banger, which is right up my musical alley. I really like how there are several switch ups in the production throughout the song. It honestly comes across as a bit of a mashup of musical ideas from both artists, with Shakira even rapping for a bit near the end, yet it still comes across as a cohesive final product. If I had to draw an issue with this track, it might be that Shakira seems a little too harsh on Piqué’s current partner. Having said that, I can probably excuse that on her deliberately acting as a bitter, jaded ex. An **8/10** for me.

# #95: “I Wrote The Book” - Morgan Wallen

---

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myFjdIpTZS0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myFjdIpTZS0)

Ok so let’s talk Morgan Wallen. Country music had a huge year in the US, with four number one singles on the Billboard charts. Those watching the charts in the past few years would point to Morgan Wallen as patient zero of this trend. Despite, let’s say, a [rather major controversy](https://www.tmz.com/2021/02/02/morgan-wallen-n-word-nashville-neighbors/) against his name, Morgan Wallen has established himself over the past few years as the biggest country star in the world. A country star so big that a thoroughly mediocre album track can land as the 95th biggest song of Billboard’s 2023. The lyrical conceit of this song is pretty funny to me. Wallen boasts that he “wrote the book” on various country-themed activities like boating, trucking and logging before stating that there is one book he definitely did not write… The Bible. To be somewhat fair, I do believe Wallen when he sings about not adhering to principles of the Bible well enough, such as not cussing and drinking. There’s certainly evidence for that. The production on the chorus is also pretty bad. It’s a mess of country and trap percussion that just does not blend well. You can skip this one, it’s a **3/10**.

# #94: “Peaches & Eggplants” - Young Nudy feat. 21 Savage

---

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D17Pat5wWw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D17Pat5wWw)

Here’s our first absolute disaster on the list. This is supposed to be a strip club anthem I guess, but honestly I think playing this would probably get you laughed out of the building. Talking about strip clubs, I think this is trying to go for the same vibe as “WAP”, a strip club anthem where the enjoyment for the listener comes from the sheer silliness of the punchlines. Meanwhile, the bars here just make me feel gross and dirty. “Hit her from the back, turn her bladder deep”? “I just beat that pussy loose”? Please stop. If there is one thing that is funny, it’s the intro and chorus, filled with onomatopoeia that I assume is meant to represent the sound of sexual intercourse. If you’re interested, listen to the first 20 seconds. It’s certainly an experience. It’s also a **2/10**.

# #93: “Wild as Her” - Corey Kent

---

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUTpppM8xOQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUTpppM8xOQ)

Even when Morgan Wallen isn’t the artist on the track, we see his clear influence on country. Here, the comparison is quite direct as he is in fact, one of the songwriters. I actually don’t think the composition here is bad at all. The melody is nice and the guitars are quite well produced. The problem here is Corey Kent. On a song about meeting a wild girl on her level, this man just sounds like the most generic male country singer you could find. I do not buy into what he’s saying at all. The only thing even slightly deviant about Corey Kent is that he, unlike many others nowadays “ain’t tryna fix her.” The wildest part about this song is probably the guitar solo but it just ends so quickly. I expected a mid song and I got a mid song yet I was still disappointed by that solo, **4/10**. 

# #92: “Ain’t That Some” - Morgan Wallen

---

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jY_98uXc3D0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jY_98uXc3D0)

Ah great, it’s even more Morgan Wallen, this time directly from the man himself. I’m already running out of things to say; it’s just a country song where he lists through a bunch of country cliches like trucks and beers. He even sings about how it’s cliche to mention these things, but that’s how it is. Well if that’s how it is I don’t really see the appeal, since it seems like there’s not much else to do down (or up for me) there. Funny thing is, I think this song actually sounds pretty decent. That’s enough to bring it to a **5/10**.

# #91: “What My World Spins Around” - Jordan Davis

---

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vpyTP9pgvo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vpyTP9pgvo)

Yay more completely unremarkable country music where our personality-less singer runs through your usual country cliches before saying that none of that compares to his girl. I’m out of words already, **3/10**.

# #90: “PRC” - Peso Pluma X Natanael Cano

---

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJflWOiAc6I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJflWOiAc6I)

Now here’s a one-two punch of genre and language that will completely knock me into the Marianas Trench of unfamiliarity. This is regional Mexican music, which has blown up in the United States over the past year. More specifically, this track is an example of “corridos tumbados”, a version of traditional corrido music that covers various topics like the lives of criminals, but with an American trap music influence. From what I can tell, crime is exactly what these two are talking about as they sing about preparing and smuggling drugs and enjoying the luxury lifestyle afforded because of this. While I think the two do a decent job in selling me on how good their lives must be, there is one big problem with the song. The horns. Why are they so flatulent? Every time the guitar is featured, I think, “this is pretty good.” Then the horns come in and wash away any sense of comfort and luxury with the waft of bad production. From what I know of this genre, this will be a recurring issue. **4/10**.

# #89: “Bury Me in Georgia” - Kane Brown

---

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-RuDCGefU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-RuDCGefU)

Finally a bit of country music with some kick to it. On this track, Kane Brown sings about how his only wish in death is to be buried in Georgia over a bluesy bit of country rock. Would you look at me weirdly if I said this feels like what would happen if you got a country musician to make a My Chemical Romance song? “For my final will and testament; Let this be my last request” definitely sounds like something Gerard Way would come up with. Thinking more about it, that might be a bridge too far, while death is used here to represent ties to the land, death for MCR paints a far bleaker picture of dis-attachment. Let’s not get sidetracked too hard by that thought, this is honestly pretty fun, **6/10**.

# #88: “Area Codes” - Kaliii

---

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3pLoVClX9M](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3pLoVClX9M)

So this song interpolates the 2001 track of the same name by Ludacris featuring Nate Dogg. I’m a lazy critic so I haven’t listened to that song. Having said that, I’m also just going to assume that song is better than this one based on their respective Wikipedia pages. Now you might be asking, what the fuck do their Wikipedia pages have anything to do with song quality? The answer is of course nothing, but the original “Area Codes” page does include a list of area codes where Ludacris and Nate Dogg’s hoes are located. A whole 43 area codes. Since Kaliii mentions zero actual area codes and 43 > 0, the original must be better. Ludacris at least gives us proof that he’s a player. If you’re looking for proper analysis, I dunno, the beat is too spare for me to have any fun with this. I’ll give it a **4/10**.

# #87: “Memory Lane” - Old Dominion

---

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRzuQt70rnc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRzuQt70rnc)

I think this review would be better formatted as the thoughts I had while listening.

- Why does this song start with a disco beat?
- This is fine I guess.
- Wait a minute does this chorus actually sort of go off? This crescendo is good, let’s hope it pays off.
- Are you kidding me, you just transitioned back into the verses. Boring.
- *Song gets around to the chorus again*. Well let’s hope the crescendo is paid off this time.
- LET’S GO, a guitar solo… Wait a minute this solo is limp. How have I been disappointed by yet another weak country guitar solo in a song I had no expectations for.
- **5/10**

# #86: “Por Las Noches” - Peso Pluma

---

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acr5b7ZanDA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acr5b7ZanDA)

In contrast to our previous regional Mexican entry, we don’t have any distracting horns on this song, with Peso Pluma here accompanied by a simple acoustic arrangement. I like the instrumentation on this song; it would be the sort of thing I would enjoy listening to performed by a live band, while sitting back in a deckchair on holiday somewhere in Mexico. I think the main thing holding this song back is Peso Pluma. I just don’t like his voice that much. It wasn’t so much of a problem back on “PRC” since Natanael Cano did far more work there (and also because there was another far bigger problem with that song), but here it just distracts me from the otherwise good vibes. The lyrics are apparently about being heartbroken after his girl left him, but they don’t matter too much to the English speaking listener. I’ll take the good with the bad here, **5/10**.

# #85: “Handle On You” - Parker McCollum

---

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqkNGbd3V1E](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqkNGbd3V1E)

In Ancient Greek tragedies, the moment of catharsis represented the purging of negative emotion and sin, bringing forth a renewed emotional state. As the audience, we recognise the mistakes made throughout the story and feel a sense of catharsis as all that is wrong is purged as our character comes to a sense of acceptance and understanding. This is exactly what I felt listening to “Handle On You”, a country song that felt purpose built to purge my brain of all the mistakes made in our previous country entries. That means having a guitar solo that actually pays off, balanced production, a singer who appears to actually have a personality and maybe most importantly, no stupid cliches. The thing is, this track in a vacuum is itself a moment of catharsis. In it, Parker McCollum sings about using alcohol to forget about a breakup. While this subject might suit a sad song, the production is bright and comforting, as if the alcohol is doing its job and settling our protagonist down, clearing his mind of the mental torment of the breakup. This has definitely washed away the stench of bad country and for that, it gets an **8/10**.

# #84: “Last Christmas” - Wham!

---

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8gmARGvPlI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8gmARGvPlI)

Help me! I am listening to a Christmas song on November 28th! I have becomes the very thing I have sworn to destroy! Now to be serious, I don’t want to get into the topic of Christmas music too heavily, since anything I say will point me out to be no fun (which would be correct). I will therefore limit my thoughts to two points:

- Christmas music shouldn’t appear on year end charts as they block out other entries that can be more representing of the listening public’s taste from that year.
- The best Christmas music doesn’t actually focus on Christmas

And so we get to “Last Christmas” by Wham!, a Christmas song focusing on heartbreak over festivity. A Christmas song where the sleigh bells are kept to a minimum behind the delicate gloss of 80s synth. A Christmas song prioritising gorgeous minimalism over busy production. Naturally, it’s my favourite Christmas song of all time. It’s also my first **10/10** on the list.

# #83: “WAIT FOR U”: Future feat. Drake & Tems

---

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP09GUQFDFk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP09GUQFDFk)

*Before proper getting into this song, I should mention this is the first of a few songs which have already appeared in a previous Billboard Year End 100. I’ll still review them all, but these songs won’t be eligible for the top and bottom 10 that I will include at the end. All Christmas songs also won’t be eligible.*

On with the actual review, and to be honest, this is another one of those songs that I don’t have much to say about. The best part is clearly the sample, of Tems’ “Higher”, which basically acts as the song’s hook. Otherwise, I didn’t really care much for the song’s content as Future and Drake mull over some past relationships. Their verses really don’t matter much, this song is all about the nice vibes carried by the sample. I’ll say **6/10**.

# #82: “Seven” - Jungkook feat. Latto

---

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QU9c0053UAU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QU9c0053UAU)

BTS ARMY ASSEMBLE! No I don’t mean that I’m part of the BTS stan group, what I mean is that with BTS on hiatus so that their members can complete South Korea’s mandatory military service, we could probably eventually assemble an actual BTS army. It’s a stupid idea but no more stupid than the concept underlining this song, where Jungkook tells his lover how he’s going to love her on all seven days of the week. Jungkook is in fact so enthusiastic about this that the chorus is just him telling us what the days of the week are. While this would certainly fit in a Sesame Street sing-a-long (apart from the implication that he is making love to his partner every day), I don’t quite think it works on a pop song. It’s just one of those concepts that sounds so stupid that I just check out whenever listening. The rest of the track isn’t much to write home about either. Latto has a rap verse which just doesn’t work at all. She brings a much more explicit energy to the song which does not match the more nudge and wink style of intimacy that the rest of the song goes for. On the positive side, at least the song sounds decent. In conclusion, I don’t think this is very good. Sorry Army, please don’t shoot me. I wanted to gives this a 7/10, but I can’t. **4/10**.

# #81: “What Was I Made For?” - Billie Eilish

---

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cW8VLC9nnTo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cW8VLC9nnTo)

Hey look, it’s a sad and spare Billie Eilish piano ballad where she sings about losing touch with her passion for music. In other words it’s a cheat code for an amazing song. About the song’s topic, this track comes from the “Barbie” movie soundtrack. Now I have not watched “Barbie” so I definitely have missed whatever subtext is going on. Instead, all I have is Billie Eilish painting a picture of detachment, pointing out the way the music industry manufactures the ideal of a pop star for business. As with all her piano ballads, the spare, minimalist production, combined with her gorgeous upper register help build up the devastating impact of the lyrical content. Having said that, if there’s one gripe I have with this song, it’s that I don’t think there is enough detail in the lyrics to hit as hard as something like “when the party’s over”, which is my favourite Billie Eilish song. What is here still hits hard though, lines like: “I’m sad again, don’t tell my boyfriend; It’s not what he’s made for”… Damn she’s doesn’t miss, **9/10**.

# #80: “Dial Drunk” - Noah Kahan with Post Malone

---

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGVRsIDNuKU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGVRsIDNuKU)

I’ve never been good at making predictions, but I’ll make one here anyway, probably more out of sheer hope than anything: Folk/Singer-Songwriter music will define the next year or two in popular music. Why do I say this? Because before a volcano erupts, you can identify the warning signs. Whether it be the arrival of more traditional country sounds (which we’ll get to later in the list), boygenius getting nominated for Grammy awards, or fucking Mitski of all people charting near the end of the year, a storm is brewing. One of those artists ushering in my prophesied future is Noah Kahan, whose 2022 album “Stick Season” blew up big this year, no thanks to the star power brought by Post Malone in this track. As for the song itself, Kahan and Malone expertly capture the compelling train wreck of a man spiralling into alcohol abuse as he desperately clings onto a relationship where the girl clearly wants nothing to do with him. Our narrator is clearly not meant to be “the good guy”; while he basically harasses his ex by repeatedly dialling drunk, he also refuses to take any blame by reason of alcohol abuse. Despite this, I sort of picture this song as the perfect campfire sing-a-long. The sort of song where after drowning your sorrows in alcohol, you blast out in sorrowful unity with your mates and the narrator, guilty conscience be damned. I hope we see more like this on the charts next year, **9/10**.

# #79: “Super Freaky Girl” - Nicki Minaj

---

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uAR9w7LBg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uAR9w7LBg)

On the topic of trends, one of the biggest over the past year or two has been the use of some of the most egregious sample choices I have seen. Just trust me when I say that Nicki Minaj sampling Rick James’ “Super Freak” is not even close to being the worst example of this I have seen recently. But seriously why? She obviously knows that this song won’t ever be the most famous track sampling “Super Freak”. I don’t think the song itself is that bad; Nicki is too good a rapper and of course the sample is good; but I don’t think there will be many songs on this list that I respect less. It’s just so lazy and unoriginal. The cherry on the cake is the fact that this track was produced by Dr. Luke. Why do we keep him around if he’s not even going to provide us with anything interesting. A perfect **5/10** for me.

# #78: “Rich Men North of Richmond” - Oliver Anthony Music

---

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqSA-SY5Hro](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqSA-SY5Hro)

Reader, I have bad news. We’re going to have to talk politics… Here goes nothing. I have been running a theory through my head recently. Conservatives are basically just racist K-pop stans. They both worship their idols. They both harrass anyone who has anything bad to say bout their ideology. They are both completely unreasonable to deal with. And most importantly to our list, they both buy and stream music records en masse to boost their chosen horse in the race to number one. And that is how we get “Rich Men North of Richmond” by Oliver Anthony Music, a number one hit in the United States of America championed by some of the world’s greatest minds like Marjorie Taylor Greene, Joe Rogan and Matt Walsh. Wonderful.

It’s no surprise why conservatives love this song. It contains all their most overused talking points whether it be rich politicians taking control of your life, high taxes, QAnon adjacent conspiracies or welfare queens. This makes it all the more hilarious that after the song was played on a Republican presidential debate, Anthony responded with a video claiming that they were the exact people he was talking about in the song. Honestly, after this revelation, everything about this song fell into place for me. This really is the perfect anthem of the rural working class American. It is an anthem for all those who aren’t given the opportunity to know any better. It is an anthem for those who continue to support conservative politics despite the fact that conservative politicians don’t care about them. It is an anthem that has become a weapon for those in the extreme right who are callous enough to weaponise their audience’s ignorance, to those who don’t want their audience to know better. I agree Oliver Anthony. Those “Rich Men North of Richmond” don’t care about you. I just wish everyone had the same idea of who those people are.

Christ I hate doing this, so let’s finish this. The song is very human. I do think it speaks from the heart. That doesn’t mean I have to like it. The talking points are awful and the production just sounds amateur (because it actually is). A **1/10,** I sure hope we don’t have to deal with any more conservative country music…

# #77: “Nobody Gets Me” - SZA

---

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNd_ufPG3x4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNd_ufPG3x4)

Another example underlining my point about folk and singer-songwriter music becoming huge, “Nobody Gets Me” probably draws more similarities to acts like Phoebe Bridgers (with whom SZA collaborated with on her album SOS) than her usual R&B style. Of course, SZA excels in both genres in exactly the same way; her vocal expressiveness can carry whatever track she’s on. Here, SZA laments over her breakup with her ex-fiance, pleading into the void for him to return as she can’t see herself with anyone but him. SZA really sells the desperation of her grief, using sex as a coping mechanism, helping her hide from the acceptance that her ex would never take back someone so emotionally ruined by the break up. To be honest, a SZA ballad appearing on the list was always going to work for me. Nobody gets SZA, but I get this song, **8/10**.

# #76: “What It Is (Block Boy)” - Doechii feat. Kodak Black

---

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phtcAd8j6Ro](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phtcAd8j6Ro)

Now this was frustrating. Imagine that you’ve baked a lovely cake. You’re preparing the icing, it’s about to go on. Then disaster strikes. Some idiot ruins everything by walking up and pouring hot sauce all over your cake. You are Doechii and that idiot is Kodak Black, whose rap verse just completely ruins a perfectly good track beforehand. We’ll start with the positives. This song contains one of the best hooks I’ve heard on the list so far, providing a melodic take on an interpolation of [“Some Cut” by Trillville](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZd2MEOvdQ4). The production does a good job backing Doechii up, providing bounce with occasional bursts of intensity from the piano, and helping accentuate the playful flirtation of the lyrical content. At this point, I’m having a great time. Then Kodak Black arrives to play the titular Block Boy. Now the only Block Boy I know about is Minecraft Steve and honestly, that would be a pretty apt comparison here as Kodak Black rides the beat about as well as your average 10 year old YouTube parodist. Him stumbling through his verse completely kills the track’s momentum. Doechii’s return on the back half is welcome but by this time, the cake is ruined. You know Kodak’s verse is bad when there’s a solo version without him that exists. Sadly, this version is what became popular. What a waste, **5/10**.

# #75: “I Like You (A Happier Song)” - Post Malone feat. Doja Cat

---

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7aekxC_monc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7aekxC_monc)

When musical artists come together to make duets, an important factor to consider is the chemistry between them. Whether they work together or not for me basically boils down to the question: “Do I believe their roles opposite each other?” For this song, the answer is obviously no. An answer of yes would require Post Malone and Doja Cat to be a believable couple. That is definitely not the case. For starts I find Post Malone to be completely unconvincing as a head-over-heels happy in love type of guy. The man’s vibe has always been completely drugged up to mask the pain type. When man is dropping lines like “Your heart’s so big, but that ass is huge”, you know that he does not care. Neither does Doja Cat, whose usual vibrant personality is completely stripped away here. None of her usual memorable lines, nothing to convince me here that she’s happy being with Post Malone. I guess once again, the arrangement isn’t that bad, but that doesn’t matter when the song is that empty, **3/10**. Please give us a better duet…

# #74: “I Remember Everything” - Zach Bryan feat. Kacey Musgraves

---

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZVVvJjwzl6c](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZVVvJjwzl6c)

Turns out prayers can be true because this song is something special. Seriously, when I made that prediction about folk/singer-songwriter music I specifically had Zach Bryan in mind as the guy who would carry the torch with his folk-country sound. This song debuting at number one this year only solidified my convictions. Having said that, Zach Bryan isn’t the most important person here… What sacrifices were made to the gods to allow us to have Kacey Musgraves on a number one hit? Her 2018 album “Golden Hour” is fantastic and won Album of the Year at the Grammy’s, yet her biggest charting song before this was 2014’s “Follow Your Arrow” which only peaked at #60.

Anyways, remember all the complaints I had about the previous entry… well this one basically excels where the other failed. Zach Bryan and Kacey Musgraves have incredible chemistry together as they reminisce on a failed relationship. I love how nostalgia and time play into the track, as alcohol is used as a recurring coping mechanism, in the past used as their only joy together, in the present used to forget the past. I love how the duet helps bring balance and complexity to the song. It reminds me a lot of 2012’s “Somebody That I Used To Know”, another surprise number one hit where the interplay between male and female perspectives help bring new light to the characters’ stories. Whereas Bryan is more reflective and regretful, Musgraves is more scathing, cutting into her ex’s drinking and how it lead to him ignoring her own troubles. Then they come together, singing the chorus to each other, each recognising how they will each always bear the scars of the relationship forever. I’m honestly glad that this came right after our previous entry because it really shows how impactful chemistry and authenticity elevate music. Imagine if Post Malone and Doja Cat were singing this, none of the emotional resonance would come through at all. So yeah, this is incredible, **10/10**.

# #73: “Bebe Dame” - **Fuerza Regida X Grupo Frontera**

---

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oie--p6YqJo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oie--p6YqJo)

More regional Mexican music, this time falling under the banner of Mexican cumbia, not that I really know what that means. I certainly like the vibe of this one a bit more than our previous regional Mexican entries. The backing band provides a nice atmosphere, while the backing vocals give an enjoyable communal energy. My main gripe with this song is probably that it runs a bit too long without enough ideas to justify the length. Ironic given how I hate the prevalence of shorter songs nowadays but whatever, this is decent, **6/10**.

# #72: “WHERE SHE GOES” - Bad Bunny

---

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bef8QLNHubw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bef8QLNHubw)

Two Spanish-language songs in a row, this one taking a much different direction than our previous entry. Bad Bunny is most well known for his reggaeton and hip-hop music, but this song draws far more from Jersey Club music, distinguished by the triplet percussion that drives the beat in this song. The club sound is a good fit for the content, where Bad Bunny appears to be in peak horndog mode, especially in the second verse which is just straight up dirty talk. I don’t particularly think this track is well suited to any place except the club, where the sweaty, pulsating energy would go off, especially in that second verse where the percussion properly kicks in, but I’ve heard far worse club music. **7/10**.

# #71: “A Holly Jolly Christmas” - Burl Ives

---

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_dI6fVZwd0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_dI6fVZwd0)

Ok, I’m going to have to come up with a way to talk about Christmas music in the future without sounding like the Grinch because Christ was this an agonising experience. From the usual overused sleigh bells to the chipperness of the entire experience, my depressed self just can’t deal with this. The lyrics don’t help either; I’m actually just that unfun that I can find the lyrics of Christmas songs objectionable. Burl Ives, there definitely will not be snow here down under, and even more certainly no one waiting under the mistletoe for me. **3/10**, and only because old music instrumentation (except the sleigh bells) will always reign supreme.

*P.S I actually do love the festive season, I’ve just always had an aversion to music that is about being happy/having fun without reason. I know that Christmas is supposed to be that reason but I still need more. We’ll get into that deeper on some future Christmas entries.*

# #70: “Tomorrow 2” - GloRilla feat. Cardi B

---

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwa7NzNBQig](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwa7NzNBQig)

I honestly admire this trend of getting Cardi B on a remix to carry the track and then giving the song the most obvious title possible. We already saw this with “Put It on da Floor Again”, a remix of the original “Put It on da Floor”, an we see it again now with “Tomorrow 2”, a remix of the original “Tomorrow”. To be fair to GloRilla, she’s a better rapper than Latto, her gruffer delivery exuding confident energy as she disses her haters. I also really like the optimism provided in the chorus, when she shrugs off all her past problems to look forwards to tomorrows. Having said that, Cardi B obviously is the star here. She just has all the intangibles down to perfect in terms of charisma and attitude. In her verse, she runs through her usual routine of flexing and dissing with potential shots thrown at Nicki Minaj whilst also referencing Ice Spice. Shout out to the production as well. That piano line sounds menacing and goes hard, helping back up GloRilla and Cardi’s bars. This is great, **8/10**. Coincidentally enough, our next entry is…

# #69: “Princess Diana” - Ice Spice & Nicki Minaj

---

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMq-I0dejjE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMq-I0dejjE)

Nice. I mean seriously the fact that Ice Spice is coming in at #69 has got to be definitive proof that the charts are rigged. There is no other possible explanation. I didn’t get Ice Spice for a while. Certainly, her detractors say that she’s monotone and only has one flow. These things are certainly true, but I then realised something. That shit sounds cool, that’s why people like her. When you listen to an Ice Spice song, you know exactly what you’re getting, namely Ice Spice sounding cool running through the usual hip-hop flexes, yet never losing her populist flair. Nicki is also pretty good on this track but more than that, I just admire all the fighting game references she put in, from “Finish ‘em” to the “Hadouken” ad-lib in her verse. So yeah, this is also good, **7/10**.

# #68: “Jingle Bell Rock” - Bobby Helms

---

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z0ajuTaHBtM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z0ajuTaHBtM)

I am about to stab someo…… actually this isn’t too bad. Sure, I don’t know how retail workers get through the season without tossing themselves off the closest cliff face but this probably isn’t too bad on occasional listen. I think it helps that as advertised, this song provides a bit more rock flair compared to the retro blandness of “A Holly Jolly Christmas.” It’s only a **5/10** for me, but I would still put it on if asked to make a Christmas playlist.

# #67: “Tennessee Orange” - Megan Moroney

---

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPacja3hGdA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPacja3hGdA)

While going through this list, I have had to encounter a lot of styles that I am unfamiliar with, like Regional Mexican, non-English songs, and even country music. All of that is dwarfed by the biggest culture shock of all to my poor Australian brain… College Football. Apparently, Americans love watching college students play American Football, so much so that they managed to launch this song, about wearing a rival team’s colours for a boy, to country hit status. Of course, that’s not the only reason this became big, the song gained hype and popularity even before release because of social media posts of Moroney wearing a shirt that fans speculated belonged to Morgan Wallen. Yep. Morgan Wallen has such a large fandom that he’s even able to create mediocre country hits by proxy. I think the culture shock definitely plays a part to me not liking this as I just don’t grasp the stakes of the story. Is wearing Tennessee orange the only thing that you can impress this boy? Why isn’t he returning the favour and wearing Georgia red? I think he doesn’t like you as much as you like him Megan. The problem is, without investment into college football, there just isn’t enough to sell me on how in love Megan is. The boy has blue eyes and doesn’t make you cry, that’s so low a bar a newborn baby could jump over that. Sorry Americans, I don’t like this, **4/10**.

# #66: “Try That In A Small Town” - Jason Aldean

---

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1_RKu-ESCY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1_RKu-ESCY)

I lied to you. I haven’t listened to every song on the Billboard Year End List of 2023. I never had any intention to. Why? Because “Try That In A Small Town” by Jason Aldean exists. Fuck this song, I’m never listening to it. Now you may ask what about this song is so detestable? Because guess what, you thought there was only on conservative driven number one hit this year? Well you were wrong. In this song, Jason Aldean sings about crime in the big city and how you can get away with violence, robbery, disrespecting the police and stomping on the American flag. He then makes a dare, “try that in a small town; see how far you make it down the road.” These lyrics and sentiments would be nasty, but not utterly detestable in themselves. The problem, and where the controversy started is the music video, where Jason Aldean sings over images of protests in the streets, while performing in front of a courthouse in Tennessee where a lynching took place in 1927 (interesting two consecutive songs for Tennessee). Yep, in this music video, Jason Aldean appears to be conflating Black Lives Matter protests with violence, before threatening these protestors with small town violence. Any excuse that Aldean’s chorus doesn’t actually threaten violence is completely gone by the second verse where he sings about how in small towns, people aren’t going to allow gun control to take away their firearms. There’s only one way this is going.

So obviously this song is heinous, but I just want to dig a bit deeper into the culture that enables this sort of stuff to become popular. Like “Rich Men North of Richmond”, this was driven to number one thanks to the legion of k-pop st… sorry I mean conservatives that bought the song. The thing is, this song was released on May 22 2023; the song only became popular after its video was withdrawn from Country Music Television rotation, four days after its release on July 14th 2023. No one cared until the controversy started, allowing for the song to be rallied around as a conservative symbol. I think this is pretty emblematic of what I hate about modern political discussion. With rage-baiting and hatred becoming the norm, any reasonable person must take action, whether it be criticism or yes, censorship like what CMT did. The problem is, that’s what they want. Far right ideologues know that their politics are nothing without fear, hence the rage-baiting to provoke that dreaded us versus them debate that only furthers divisions. And so, I know that any criticism from me crying racism is exactly playing into the game conservatives want to play, hence I’ll try a different approach.

A lot is made about how some of the lyrics, as well as the video are intentionally racist. Jason Aldean and his supporters say that these themes simply invoke small town life. I believe them… and that’s the entire problem. These people just don’t seem to understand the importance of cultural context and history, how for many life in a small town is inexorably tied to exclusion. For example, when Aldean sings about the “good ol’ boys”, he might believe he’s celebrating people who work hard to uphold strong American values, yet for others, this could refer to the entrenchment of racist conservative white standards. You can’t tell me that you’re only talking about community and taking care of your neighbours when these tropes have been used to perpetuate racism and exclusion for so long. To be honest, I’m probably being a bit too kind with this interpretation, I’ll balance that with a historic **0/10**.

# #65: “TQG” - Karol G X Shakira

---

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZGpkLElSu8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZGpkLElSu8)

Honestly I find it pretty funny that after getting through so many Spanish language songs, it’s only now that we get to our first straight up reggaeton song. I think it’s also a pretty good song. Shakira clearly has even more to say about her ex even after “Bzrp Music Sessions, Vol. 53”, joining Karol G in asserting their independence from their respective former relationships and dissing their exes inability to get over them. When it comes to reggaeton, my understanding is that the most mediocre offerings from the genre are those that don’t do anything to distinguish themselves from each other over the stock beat. This isn’t the case here, the hook is sticky and the melodic switch up on the third verse/bridge breathe freshness into the track. I like this, **7/10**.

# #64: “Eyes Closed” - Ed Sheeran

---

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6wOyMUs74I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6wOyMUs74I)

You’re Ed Sheeran and you want to go back to basics for you upcoming album “-”, returning back to the folk-pop sounds that you started your career with. So what do you do? You recruit Aaron Dessner from The National, the guy who produced Taylor Swift’s “Folklore” and “Evermore” which served as her own back to basics albums. And so we get “Eyes Closed” a song paying tribute to the death of a close friend of Sheeran. Honestly, that does make me feel bad… because I’m going to have to rip into Ed Sheeran’s heartfelt tribute song, this just does not work for me. My biggest problem is the general melody going through the verses, it sounds clumsy unlike the grace of any “Folklore”-era Taylor Swift track. I don’t think the chorus works either. Ed wrote this song with producers Max Martin and Shellback and their usual maximalist pop feels restrained by the gentler production. It sort of feels like the chorus was written for a different song. I guess the lyrics are quite touching but even then I don’t think they have the crushing detail of (and I hate to use this comparison again) a “Folklore”/”Evermore” era Taylor Swift song. The most I can can give this is a **4/10**.

# #63: “Lift Me Up” - Rihanna

---

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mx_OexsUI2M](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mx_OexsUI2M)

Did we seriously wait six years for some solo Rihanna output only for her to give us this? “Lift Me Up” was recorded for the soundtrack for “Black Panther: Wakanda Forever”. I remember the first Black Panther movie having some pretty good soundtrack singles courtesy of The Weeknd and SZA. Meanwhile, I don’t think this is very good at all. I guess we can start off with the positives, Rihanna and the production both sound excellent. I could maybe see someone getting value out of this song with its relaxing, comforting vibes. Unfortunately, that someone is not me. When it comes to ballads with spare production, I always prefer smaller, intimate vocals. I think it helps the track feel fuller than it actually is. Rihanna sounds great, but her powerful delivery makes the track feel empty. This is only amplified by the lyrics. There’s basically no variation between the verses, which are themselves only five lines long. Then there’s the structure, which just alternates between these short verses and choruses, no bridge to provide some variety. This definitely isn’t the worst song on this list from delivery alone, but it might just be the most creatively bereft, **3/10**.

# #62: “Daylight” - David Kushner

---

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoN9ql6Yymw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoN9ql6Yymw)

*Me: Can we have “Take Me To Church” by Hozier*

*Mum: We have “Take Me To Church” by Hozier at home*

*“Take Me To Church” by Hozier at home…*

Seriously, from the religious themes to the deep baritone vocals to the almost gothic sounding bombast, they do feel very similar. The key difference is detail. Listening to this song felt like the biggest revelation, I finally realise why I’m shit at writing essays. When you hit upon a theme, you have to provide context, detail, something to engage the reader/listener. David Kushner spends the entire time singing about being torn apart by desire for something harmful to him. He uses metaphors and themes of light and dark to emphasise the paradox. He never tells you what he’s actually singing about. So why should I care? For all I know he could be talking about how his desire for Valorant skins is biting into his personal finances. David Kushner says that this was one of the [fastest songs he every wrote](https://www.papermag.com/david-kushner#rebelltitem22) and it shows, **2/10**. 

# #61: “Dancin’ In The Country” - Tyler Hubbard

---

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ma3L7xWB_1U](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ma3L7xWB_1U)

In the early 2010s, someone had an idea, a very bad idea, to mix hip-hop and country. The result was bro-country, probably the musical genre of the 2010s that we will have the hardest time justifying to our future generations. Now in 2023, bro-country is practically dead, with its practitioners needing to find other sounds to explore, which is where we get to Tyler Hubbard of leading bro-country act Florida Georgia Line leaning into a fusion of country and disco. Now bro-country was known for being a particularly embarrassing genre and frankly, this song is no different, especially in the pseudo hip-hop pre chorus. Having said that, I can’t bring myself to actually hate this. It’s too earnestly stupid and committed to having fun that it sort of becomes infectious. Don’t get me wrong, the song is too embarrassing to be even close to good, but I can see its place on the country dance floors, **5/10**.

# #60: “Rockin’ Around The Christmas Tree” - Brenda Lee

---

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFsZy9t-qDc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFsZy9t-qDc)

Picture this, you’re looking at the Spotify charts during the Christmas season of 2023 (well November but Santa comes earlier than your average virgin every year) and you see something that makes you pause. Right at the top of the US charts does not sit Mariah Carey. No, the Queen of Christmas has been dethroned and instead at the top is “Rockin’ Around The Christmas Tree” by Brenda Lee. Around a week and a half later, I am writing this review on the 7th December 2023 and it is official, Brenda Lee currently holds the top spot on the Billboard Hot 100. Honestly, that makes me happy, because this is a damn solid Christmas classic. You can take everything I said about “Jingle Bell Rock” and upgrade it for this. I like the early 60s rock sound and Brenda Lee sounds fantastic over it, actually being able to sell me on the communal spirit of Christmas. It certainly helps that there are no sleigh bells ruining everything. Indeed, apart from the choir backup, this isn’t the most Christmas sounding song and that’s a plus for me, **7/10**.

# #59: “Going, Going, Gone” - Luke Combs

---

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG-JNwGYAjo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG-JNwGYAjo)

Let us cast our minds back all the way to my review of the 93rd biggest song of 2023, “Wild as Her” by Corey Kent. If you don’t remember, my big issue with that song is how unconvincing Corey Kent is as the sort of dude who could match a “wild girl” on her level. Luke Combs isn’t like that. He doesn’t pretend that he’s the sort of wandering spirit that can fulfil everything this girl needs in life, he’s just going to let her go so she can spread her wings and do what she really wants. I think the maturity of this song is its strength, Combs is certainly wistful, but he knows his decision is for the best, singing: “I can’t hold on to letting go; Change the way the river flows”. The instrumentation is also really nice, providing a warm, sentimental background to Combs’ lyrics. As with a lot of our entries, I think the song could maybe do with a bit more detail; there are only two short verses and a two line bridge to flesh out the content, but I can’t complain too much, **7/10**.

# #58: “Heart Like A Truck” - Lainey Wilson

---

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNReepITjN0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNReepITjN0)

Ok country music I know that you guys really like your trucks, but do you think that the metaphor’s gone maybe a little too far this time? As the title of this song suggests, Lainey Wilson compares her heart to a truck, in how it might be worn down a bit but just needs a little bit of love to keep it going. To be fair, I don’t always hate the metaphor, especially when she describes how her heart yearns for the freedom of the open road (is she the girl Luke Combs sings about?). The problem is of course in how there might be a little too much detail this time. Lines like “I gotta hankerin’ for four wide tires; And I can’t help it, it’s just the way I’m wired” and “Runs on dreams and gasoline” just confuse me. Metaphor does not mean you are literally the thing you are comparing yourself to. It’s a shame, since Lainey Wilson sells the hell out of this theme. I love the buildup to this song, with each chorus progressively becoming more unrestrained until the final one, where Wilson kicks into top gear and belts out the hook as if what she’s singing is the most important thing she’ll ever say and not actually a stupid fucking metaphor. I respect that a lot but that’s not enough to make the song anything above average, **6/10**.

# #57: “Chemical” - Post Malone

---

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzPQ_jA00bk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzPQ_jA00bk)

This song was Post Malone’s first single released after “I Like You (A Happier Song)”. Thankfully, it seems like after seeing his complete lack of chemistry with Doja Cat, he decided to dive head first into finding chemistry with copious drug usage. In short, Post Malone decided to return to what he does best. It’s serious how stark in contrast this song is to “I Like You (A Happier Song)”. While both sound upbeat, they convey completely different themes, with this song using the energetic indie rock beat to convey the soaring highs felt at the best moments of his relationship, even as he sings about struggling to leave this woman. I mean, if the best moments sound as good as this song are, I don’t blame him, even as the chaos leads him down towards fighting, and yes, implied drug abuse to keep the high going. I’ve always had a soft spot for upbeat songs with dark themes, **8/10**.

# #56: “Everything I Love” - Morgan Wallen

---

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MEv4Hzf8Hhw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MEv4Hzf8Hhw)

I’m really sorry. I don’t want to beat a dead horse here but seriously… DETAIL PLEASE, PUT SOME DETAIL INTO YOUR MUSIC SO THAT I CAN CARE. Morgan Wallen sings about how his ex has ruined all the places that he used to love since he took her to those places. The thing is, he doesn’t ever say what she did to him, or try to even tie his experiences with her to these locations. Now you could probably argue that such detail isn’t needed, that the country rollick, combined with Wallen’s usual ode to all things country is enough to attract an audience. And wure, I guess this sounds pretty good, I just wish it did more to take it to the next level, **6/10**.

# #55: “All I Want For Christmas Is You” - Mariah Carey

---

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAkMkVFwAoo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAkMkVFwAoo)

I mean do I really need to say that much here. It’s “All I Want For Christmas Is You” by Mariah Carey, what else is there to be added to the conversation. She may have been dethroned this year, but this for me (and probably everyone let’s be honest) will always be THE Christmas song. I mean, this is a song so perfectly Christmas that even with all the sleigh bells and overplay, I will always have some place in my heart for it. I guess for me, being a Christmas song which isn’t solely about Christmas helps, as it lends some more weight to Mariah’s joy. Even then, it’s Mariah Carey, she could probably make “Holly Jolly Christmas” work… actually scratch that no one can save that abortion of a tune. Well anyways, most of all, it’s just nice seeing a Christmas song that doesn’t forget that it can actually still be a pop song, **9/10**.

# #54: “wait in the truck” - HARDY feat. Lainey Wilson

---

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsMB0i5YTOc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsMB0i5YTOc)

Now here’s a humdinger of a song so strap in because this is a wild ride. First off, hello Lainey Wilson, you really do seem to like trucks do you. Anyways, let’s look at the plot of this song. HARDY is driving through heavy rain in his truck when he sees a woman on the side of the road. After he lets her into his truck, he notices that she has clearly been physically abused and asks her where he can find her abuser. After driving to the abuser’s place and telling her to wait in the truck, HARDY shoots the abuser dead before he can reach for his shotgun. Now I mean I don’t even know where to start here. I think to me this song really comes across as a power fantasy for HARDY. He stands up for women and protects them from abusers. He ain’t no angel since he killed a man, but he doesn’t regret any bit of his actions. He’s a badass. All this focus from HARDY’s point of view detracts from the wider repercussions of his actions. Sure, the woman in the story is thankful for his actions and visits him in prison, but I dunno, there’s a lot of questions I have to ask. Does she feel guilty for her abuser’s death? Did she get any say into what he deserved? Maybe I’m overthinking things, for all I know she’s perfectly fine with everything, but at least I’m putting more thought into the ethics of killing someone than our protagonist just waltzing in so he can assert his masculine protective urges. There’s certainly a place for murder ballads, there’s certainly catharsis in seeing someone evil get what they deserve. I just don’t think this song achieves that. For me, it just leaves the underlying taste of scrotum in my mouth, **4/10**.

# #53: “Made You Look” - Meghan Trainor

---

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPCCYMeXin0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPCCYMeXin0)

Meghan Trainor is a psyop, deployed into the pop culture sphere by the CIA to test audio forms of torture for use in Guantanamo Bay. At least that’s the only explanation I can come up with for the continued success of Meghan Trainor, a popstar whose greatest strength in my opinion is their unique ability to find new and inventive ways to annoy me. After blowing up in 2014 with “All About That Bass”, Trainor followed up with some of the worst pop songs ever recorded. From “Marvin Gaye” with Charlie Puth, a song more ruinous to the great man’s legacy than any of the litigious adventures his estate has set forth in his name, to “Me Too”, a song where the level of enjoyment in listening can be compared to being repeatedly punched in the face, Trainor’s music always had that dash of sadism that constitutes the best torture methods. But then… she went away. For several years, we thought that it was over, that no longer would Meghan Trainor ruin the airwaves. That was until 2022, when inexplicably, she managed to make us look. And what a song she did it with. “Made You Look” is classic Meghan Trainor with its 50s doo-wop stylings, complete lack of any groove and annoying vocals. Most of all though, it’s that hook. Being forced to hear that enough times would easily extract any state secrets from me. As a body positivity anthem, I don’t want to shit on that aspect of this song too much, but I will say that I would probably struggle to find any empowerment in associating with a song so lacking in confidence and swagger in its sound. **1/10**.

# #52: “Paint The Town Red” - Doja Cat

---

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4_9TFeMfJE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4_9TFeMfJE)

If I were to describe Doja Cat’s year using one word, I would say Punk. Now, you might ask, what is even remotely close to punk about Doja Cat? Well, Doja Cat, like many classic punk artists loves telling her fans to fuck off. Doja Cat, like many classic punk artists, is a bit too fond of associating with Nazis for shock value. And finally, Doja Cat, like many classic punk artists still released bangers even after all the controversy. For me, seeing the success of “Paint The Town Red” felt like schadenfreude, I mean a song where Doja Cat basically cusses off her fan base going to number one on the Billboard Hot 100 is hilarious. It certainly helped that the song is itself really good. The sample of “Walk on By” by Dionne Warwick is a clear highlight, combining classic RnB refinement with Doja’s mantra of brushing away the haters. With all the egregious sampling we see nowadays (trust me there’s more coming), it felt wonderful seeing something used so tastefully. Doja’s lyrics are also fun, despite being effectively a diss track, lines like “I look better with no hair” are delivered with just the perfect amount of nonchalance for the diss to become funny. So yeah, I like this song a lot, **8/10**.

# #51: “Shirt” - SZA

---

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdFDrjfW548](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdFDrjfW548)

I don’t have much to say about this one. SZA is one of those high floor artists where basically anything she releases has some base level of good. “Shirt” is basically one of those songs. The pre-chorus and chorus hit hard with that bass but I don’t really care about the verses. I guess the lyrical content is good but I don’t think it matters too much. Apparently, previewed snippets of this song went viral on TikTok before its release. I’m not surprised, **7/10**. 

# #50: “Until I Found You” - Stephen Sanchez

---

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxldQ9eX2wo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxldQ9eX2wo)

Sometimes, you see a song that just makes you think: “this is a one hit wonder.” I mean seriously, have you heard of Stephen Sanchez? Can you name another Stephen Sanchez song? I think part of what gives this impression to me is how unlike anything else this is. We see so many 80s throwbacks nowadays, but not much as retro as this, making it feel like a time capsule. I certainly think this contributes to why I like this song. I don’t think there are many popular songs out there with the same classic instrumentation, tasteful backup vocals giving some additional texture or lyrics conveying such sweetness and optimism. It’s a look at a far simpler, nicer time, **8/10**. 

# #49: “Un x100to” - Grupo Frontera X Bad Bunny

---

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3inw26U-os4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3inw26U-os4)

Now here’s an interesting combination, what happens if you combine a regional Mexican act with a reggaeton superstar? Well apparently if the artists involved are talented enough, you get some really good music. It’s always interesting seeing how artists handle themselves outside of their usual genres and Bad Bunny handles himself nicely here. Sure, his verse starts with some more familiar moody synths. However, the regional Mexican instrumentation eventually kicks back in, with Bad Bunny sounding surprisingly credible over it. The instrumentation is pretty great itself. Grupo Frontera’s thing appears to be the use of the accordion, which really helps provide a unique and warm sound. As with all our Spanish entries, I can’t comment too much on the lyrics, but they do appear to be decent, providing insight into our narrators’ heartbreak as they try to win back an ex. Definitely the best regional Mexican song I’ve heard so far, **8/10**.

# #48: “Escapism” - RAYE feat. 070 Shake

---

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dll6VJ2C7wo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dll6VJ2C7wo)

“Escapism” by RAYE featuring 070 Shake is a **10/10**. I usually don’t start with the rating because I want the rating to be an encapsulation of everything I said leading up to it. I’ll make an exception in this case, since there aren’t many songs that can draw you in and leave you just stunned by its presence on the charts. Songs this good don’t chart often. Where do I even start? If there’s one point that I have railed upon repeated in these reviews, its been the importance of detail. Detail is what gets the listener invested, what makes them actually care about the narrative and themes conveyed. “Escapism” might have the most fleshed out lyrics in the entire list. RAYE details having her heart broken in a breakup and the ensuing coping mechanisms used to numb her pain. From her single minded determination to get laid to the drug and alcohol usage to the paranoia she feels even while partying, her continued descent into debauchery; even as she accepts that escapism won’t change anything; feels compelling and tragic. When I talk about how fleshed out the song is, I don’t just mean the detail. With songs becoming shorter and shorter, it is so nice to see a guest verse, bridge and outro all providing their own pieces to the narrative. In particular, I love the parallelism in the outro, with those 4/4 kick drums providing the pulsating club soundtrack that echoes the headache and regret in RAYE’s lyrics.

I haven’t even mentioned the production yet so let’s move onto that. That synth line is absolutely filthy, providing the sense of menace and foreboding that underlines RAYE’s escapist tactics. Another highlight is how the production becomes increasingly distorted as the song moves into the final third, representing how the party and escapism begins to devolve from being perhaps enjoyable to danger and hungover regret. I guess the final thing I want to add is how well constructed this is as a pop song. Despite being four and a half minutes long, there’s a hook everywhere you look. Each section is distinct, switching up the pace and feel of the track. I love this song so much. Am I allowed to say it’s a **10/10** again? Well I guess it’s my review so I make the rules.

# #47: “Next Thing You Know” - Jordan Davis

---

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3c909oqLfao](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3c909oqLfao)

How the fuck is there a second Jordan Davis song here? Do you even remember his first entry on this list? I had nothing to say about that song and I don’t have anything to say about this one either. I guess it’s got a bit less cliche than the other one so that’s a plus, but that doesn’t matter when Jordan Davis is your front-man. This guy is what would happen if you gave a stock image model a country music career. This man is so boring and personality-less he would fit right in as a Ken extra in the Barbie Movie, **3/10**.

# #46: “Barbie World” - Nick Minaj & Ice Spice (with Aqua)

---

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUj2AWEJnwQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUj2AWEJnwQ)

I have a confession to make… I think “Barbie Girl” by Aqua is a great song. Seriously. It’s just wonderful Eurodance cheese, with a hook that perfectly toes the line between annoying and brilliant. Therefore, listening to this song offended me to my very soul. Let’s take an all timer of a hook and completely water down any of its potency so we can layer some completely generic trap percussion over it. You might find the original annoying, but it at least commanded your attention. This is just weak. Another thing is how the original has that little tinge of irony that makes you wonder if the entire thing is just satire directed at vapidity. Meanwhile, Nicki and Ice Spice play this one completely straight. I previously praised Ice Spice for her ability to mesh traditional hip-hop flexing with populism. In this song though, I just can’t buy into anything she says. They both sound checked out. I feel the same way listening to this, **2/10**.

# #45: “Search & Rescue” - Drake

---

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntp9_iznQ-0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntp9_iznQ-0)

Okay what the fuck did I just listen to? Going through this list of songs, I have to understand that I’m not going to get everything. However, that doesn’t mean I don’t understand the target audience, or what sort of appeal that each track is going for. I do not know who on Earth could find this track appealing in any sort of manner. “Search & Rescue” appears to be somewhat of a love song, with Drake looking for the right fit for him. The problem is, the production just doesn’t match at all. It’s just a piano line running through the entire song, with no switch ups to keep things interesting. Why is this song so boring? Drake does not help things at all. He sounds so robotic throughout the entire track; I cannot believe that this wasn’t AI vocals. Have I mentioned this song is as long as “Escapism”? Holy shit this thing has like a tenth of the content and ideas of that song. It would probably struggle to fill a TikTok. Even then, I have the feeling that anyone on that app would at least have the sense to avoid this turd. At the very least they understand what a hook is. So yeah, probably the most confusing song I have heard so far. Once again, who is this for? **1/10**.

# #44: “Cupid” - Fifty Fifty

---

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qc7_zRjH808](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qc7_zRjH808)

Now reviewing this one was a bit confusing. The Billboard Year End list credits the original “Cupid” which is sung in a mixture of Korean and English. However, the twin version of the song, which is only sung in English appears to be what broke them through in the US. I may be wrong though. Just in case, I decided to listen to both versions, a task which I did not mind at all since this song is pretty great. I think the obvious comparison, is Taylor Swift’s “You Belong With Me”, except with nu-disco production instead of the other’s pop-country sound. Both are bubblegum sweet love songs about unrequited love. Both are perfectly constructed to give your brain that little rush of dopamine. I think more than anything I love how this song leans into the strengths of being performed by a girl group. The harmonies are gorgeous, layering the unique vocal textures of each performer for maximum sweetness potential. There are two key differences between the original and twin version. The first is the lack of rap verse in the twin version, being replaced by some extended instrumentation. The second is the lack of key change in the twin version. In my opinion, listen to both and take what you prefer, they’re fairly equivalent in quality. This song puts the biggest smile on my face, **9/10**. I sure hope Fifty Fifty haven’t [broken up due to a contract dispute](https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/art/2023/10/732_361689.html) with their label… God damn it.

# #43: “Spin Bout U” - Drake & 21 Savage

---

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8nbNQpRwNo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8nbNQpRwNo)

Well this certainly isn’t as incompetent as our previous Drake entry but that doesn’t mean it’s good. The main problem once more is Drake. Sure I appreciate how he describes the men who overturned Roe v. Wade as those who “never got pussy in school”; but I’m not sure I’m convinced by his follow up of “I gotta protect ya”; from what he’s saying it does sound like he only cares so that he can fuck this woman. Then there’s the line “Don’t worry ‘bout your friend’s story when I had her alone.” I have to be missing something right, that surely can’t mean what it looks like. 21 Savage is a bit better in that he doesn’t say anything as self incriminating as Drake though maybe I’m just saying this considering we last saw him embarrassing himself on “Peaches & Eggplants”. I’m not sure 21 is the best at acting romantic, but his flow is pretty strong over the classy RnB sample. Honestly, listening to “Search & Rescue” made me realise how bad it can get so this actually isn’t too offensive in the grand scheme of things, **3/10**.

# #42: “Religiously” - Bailey Zimmerman

---

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYCWaK6Sbik](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYCWaK6Sbik)

The album this song comes from is called “Religiously. The Album”. With a title like that, you’re going to have to do a lot with that title track to convince me of your worth. To be fair, Bailey Zimmerman, does far more with the this song than I expected. I appreciate the detail he puts into the song. For example, the verses go over him reminiscing his time with a particular ex and how despite all the changes that have happened to him, his longing for her remains constant. Zimmerman actually does a credible job selling me on his regrets, especially during the bridge where he admits that his own faults were what ended their relationship. Unfortunately, it all goes back to that title. Religiously. I was always going to be afraid that we would end up with some bland Christian music but this song bends things differently, with Zimmerman being the one who was worshipped by this girl. Personally, I think it’s sort of weird that the only ex that this guy seems to care about is the one who treated him like a God. The titular word doesn’t even work well within the melody. Every time he sings that word, it sounds so ill fitting, square peg into a round hole style. This is definitely a mixed bag, **5/10**.

# #41: “golden hour” - JVKE

---

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PEM0Vs8jf1w](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PEM0Vs8jf1w)

Those familiar with my taste in music will know that I have a particular affinity with artists who have replaced letter(s) in their name with the letter V to help distinguish themselves in a search engine; CHVRCHES and Alvvays come to mind. Can JVKE join this exclusive club with his first hit song “golden hour”? 

No. He can’t, he’s not even close actually.

Let’s just get to the elephant in the room; those verses are embarrassing. JVKE adopts a faux rap flow and it just shows we really cannot allow white people to rap. The worst offender is the line “She knew she was the baddest”, where JVKE tries to fit in way too many syllables and ends up sounding like an idiot. I hate his delivery as well. He sounds like the sort of person who thinks what he’s doing makes him the coolest person alive. And then there’s the absolute gall of referencing Frank Ocean and Childish Gambino. You wish JVKE, you wish. I guess the appeal of this song is the chorus, which to be fair, actually is quite nice in its sweeping profession of love over the keys and strings. After hearing this song, I knew that it must have become popular on TikTok, and sure enough it was. I imagine anyone playing this song on TikTok never played the full thing to their partner or otherwise, I think they would have been broken up with on the spot for associating with this mess, **3/10**.

# #40: “La Bebe” - Yng Lvcas X Peso Pluma

---

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mchJ-EW9rM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mchJ-EW9rM)

Ooh, another artist doing that thing with the letter V; can he impress me enough to join that exclusive club?

No. He can’t, he’s not even close actually.

When I talked about bad reggaeton earlier, this is a perfect example of what I mean. There is just nothing to distinguish this song from any other in the genre. That stock beat is basically the only instrumentation through the song apart from the synths at the start, and it gets stale quickly. Yng Lvcas and Peso Pluma do not help matters. Yng Lvcas is the bigger offender; he has all the presence of an absentee father. Peso Pluma’s contribution is marginally better in that he doesn’t actually do much apart from sing over Yng Lvcas and contribute a four line verse. However, in those four lines he does encourage a girl to cheat on her boyfriend with him so make of that what you will. Honestly, I was going to write this song off as painfully mid until we reached the line: “Slanty eyes like Puki of Taiwan”. What? Surely [this translation](https://genius.com/30123803) has to be wrong. You cannot have just said that. Who are you even talking about? Fuck this song, **1/10**.

# #39: “Bad Habit” - Steve Lacy

---

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VF-FGf_ZZiI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VF-FGf_ZZiI)

I’ve decided that I’m going to try to keep things a little shorter for songs that appeared in last year’s year-end list, since I assume most people will be familiar with songs that are big enough to cross over years. I mean, it’s “Bad Habit” by Steve Lacy, who doesn’t like this song? To point out my favourite parts about the song, the guitar line is obviously iconic; and as a socially awkward dude, the lyrics do speak to me quite a bit. I think most of all, it was just really cool seeing something so indie going to number one in the US. You don’t get to see that very often. **9/10**.

# #38: “Superhero (Heroes & Villains)” - Metro Boomin, Future & Chris Brown

---

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkaWdvv-jKg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkaWdvv-jKg)

Listening to this really put into perspective how unsuited I am to reviewing hip-hop. Like what’s going on in the lyrics. I dunno, I think they’re just doing their flexing and stuff but does that matter to me? No of course not, what they’re saying is obviously not meant for me. Instead, when listening to hip-hop, I usually judge based on how hard the track goes, and this goes pretty hard. Metro Boomin’s production is great, especially that menacing lead synth. Future’s also pretty on point. I think his flows are pretty sharp and he switches things up enough to keep things interesting. Talking of switch ups, there’s a pretty big one in the last part of the song, as Metro Boomin’s trap production transforms into a pretty cool piano line. Unfortunately, this serves to introduce the villain part of the song, performed by Chris Brown. Look, I get the idea of having Chris Brown play the villain, but am I really going to want to listen to this song if he’s going to complain about people wanting to bring him down and trying to paint others as villains: “They don't wanna see you winnin’; So who's really the villain?”. No Chris, I’m very certain the guy who put Rihanna in the hospital is the villain, not “the haters”. Thankfully, there’s a version without Chris Brown so you can listen to that one if you’re interested. Sadly, that’s not the credited version so **4/10**.

# #37: “One Thing At A Time” - Morgan Wallen

---

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKA4wH3Mg7Y](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKA4wH3Mg7Y)

This is probably the least dour sounding of the Morgan Wallen songs I have had to listen too so far, which I appreciate. The guitars sound nice, and there’s a strong driving melody throughout the entire song. These lyrics though… they’re interesting to say the least. Morgan Wallen has problems with substance abuse (something we have already established). He also has relationship problems (another thing we have also already established). He wants to get over these problems but can only do so one at a time. But instead of him taking agency over his issues, he forces his ex to make the choice. He can get with her, or he can continue his substance abuse. Like wow this guy’s an asshole, especially when he says: “If you ain’t gonna kiss me; Then I’ll take some whiskey, some Grizzly; Nicotine amphetamines too.” To be fair, you can probably make the argument that he’s intentionally portraying an asshole, that this sort of insight can make for compelling storytelling. I tend to be charitable when it comes to this, but like with many of our past entries, I would like some more detail to really take things to the next level; maybe this is where pulling the duet trick would come into handy? So yeah, since I’m charitable and the song sounds nice, that’s enough to get **6/10**. Mileage though will vary for different people.

# #36: “Love You Anyway” - Luke Combs

---

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=27nRqoBQLl4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=27nRqoBQLl4)

Most of the time, not having much to say about a song is proof of its mediocrity. I might make a graph after I’m done with this thing comparing rating with words used in a review; I think the results would be interesting. However, sometimes, there’s just not much to say because the song does the basics so well that there’s nothing left to really say. “Love You Anyway” by Luke Combs fits nicely into that category. It’s just a simple country love ballad to his wife, no content that is really out of the ordinary. However, the instrumentation is so gentle and refined, Combs’ delivery so love struck and inviting, that the song is elevated into being amazing, **9/10**.

# #35: “Dance The Night” - Dua Lipa

---

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiC1rgCPmUQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiC1rgCPmUQ)

Here’s the final Barbie movie entry in our list, the lead single from that soundtrack album. This is a sound that suits Dua Lipa perfectly, basically asking us: “do you want more “Future Nostalgia”? Well yes, I do want more since that album’s great so thanks for this. Like with “Love You Anyway”, is there really much more for me to say? It’s a great dance song with a strong groove, commanding performance and who cares what lyrics. If there’s one thing that I have to point out, it would probably be the way the post-chorus is introduced only after the second chorus, helping build that extra bit of punch to put the song over the top. An **8**/**10**.

# #34: “NEED A FAVOR” - Jelly Roll

---

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1nRboaLTzU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1nRboaLTzU)

This is Jelly Roll, owner of the most stupid name in country music. You would think someone with that name would spend their time making lighter, more humorous content, but that’s not what Jelly Roll is doing. The content here is serious. Jelly Roll specifically needs a favour from God to keep him from losing a loved one (it’s ambiguous whether he means they’re dying of if he’s just being left by a girl). What makes things interesting is how Jelly Roll admits how he’s usually detached from religion, giving detail into how he only prays when he truly needs help, or how he doesn’t attend church because he’s dealing with his own personal demons regarding alcohol. I like how this gives a bit more pathos to his desperation; think a more insightful “I Wrote The Book”. My main gripe with the song is Jelly Roll himself; I don’ quite think he has the vocal power to really put this over the top and properly sell the anguish. That isn’t surprising when you find out this guy began his career as a rapper (I mean of course what country musician would name himself Jelly Roll). Still, the content is pretty solid and it rocks fairly decently so **6/10**.

# #33: “Players” - Coi Leray

---

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZV0CIFQbbE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZV0CIFQbbE)

Oh! The egregious sampling alarm is ringing again, I wonder what we’ve got this time. Ah, a sample of “The Message” by Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five, a famously highly sampled classic. And I mean, we’ve already had a number one hit that samples that song, Puff Daddy’s “Can’t Nobody Hold Me Down” from 1997. In my opinion, if a song has enough cultural ubiquity to get to number one in the US, surely that has to be the end point for any samples it uses. This song isn’t even too bad. I like how Coi Leray re-contextualises the word player from a woman’s perspective. She also seems to have a personality, actually selling me on the fact she has the confidence required to carry the track. It really just is that sample. It’s just played so straight, so devoid of any other interesting ideas that it detracts from the song, **5/10**. Funny thing is even after all that, this still isn’t the most egregious sample on the list.

# #32: “Lavender Haze” - Taylor Swift

---

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h8DLofLM7No](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h8DLofLM7No)

Hello Taylor, nice to see you here. “Lavender Haze” was the second single from her album from last year “Midnights” and is the album opener. I think it serves as a pretty good start to the album as well. My main interpretation of “Midnights” is as a portrayal of Taylor’s insecurities and the comfort felt by her relationship. The thing is, I listened to “Midnights” before she broke up with Joe Alwyn, and I haven’t gone back to it since apart from my favourite songs. Therefore, looking back at this song is quite interesting, as on the surface level, it’s specifically about Taylor finding comfort in the arms of her lover away from her melancholy and the speculation of the media. Contextualising post-breakup though, it is quite interesting to see where Taylor’s insecurities lie, such as the pressure of marriage forced upon her by the media. Outside of that though, I also like the production, which gives a sort of ethereal yet familiar feel to the track. Now I wouldn’t call this one of my absolute favourites from “Midnights” as it lacks the little bit extra to put it over the top, but it’s a great song nonetheless, **8/10**.

# #31: “fukumean” - Gunna

---

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V6ZsXKE8QmQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V6ZsXKE8QmQ)

Another hip-hop song means I’m going to follow the same formula to review it. Sure the lyrics can be a little questionable. “Shittin’ on all you lil’ turds” springs to mind; but hey, the beat is good, the flow is good, and the ad-libs throughout the song are extremely fun and catchy. I can’t complain too much then, **7/10**.

*PS: This is my only opportunity to bring this up here since this is Gunna’s only entry. You owe it to yourself to watch this clip from fellow rapper Young Thug’s trial on RICO charges.*

# #30: “vampire” - Olivia Rodrigo

---

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlPNh_PBZb4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlPNh_PBZb4)

When I first listened to “vampire” by Olivia Rodrigo on its release day, I thought it was disappointing. Maybe that was unfair, but I didn’t really care for yet another piano ballad, where the build-up comes too late to make things interesting. Mostly, it was that hook. Whenever I see criticism for this song, it’s always about the words “fame fucker”. I hate to parrot an opinion, but that’s my main issue with the song as well. It’s sounds so clunky, and as the hook, the fact that it gets repeated several times doesn’t help. It’s a shame because I’ve come around to the rest of “vampire” since I first listened. The lyrics are compelling, detailing the Rodrigo’s vulnerability and how she was manipulated by her ex. I like the build-up now, kicking the song into frantic overdrive, as Rodrigo takes ever more vicious stabs at her ex. I think that bridge is especially great, containing the best line in the song: “You can’t love anyone ‘cause that would mean you have a heart.” I do like the song now, I wish I loved it though, **8/10**. The real shame though is that “Bad Idea Right?” isn’t on this list thanks to Billboard’s weird year cutoffs. That’s the best song on the album.

*Edit: I have adjusted ratings before but I haven’t previously disclosed that since it doesn’t change the content of the review itself. However, I’m going to state here that I’m upgrading the rating here to a **9/10** because I realised that I don’t actually hate the “fame fucker” part and also because the rest of the song goes off more than I appreciated. Let’s just ignore the fact that the medium through which I figured this out was Fortnite.*

# #29: “CUFF IT” - **Beyoncé**

---

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrtWLyp5gLI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrtWLyp5gLI)

Please don’t show this to the beehive, they might do something bad to me. Now I should make it clear that I don’t think this song is bad, I just have some frustrations after listening. The main problem is the instrumentation; I think it needs to featured far more predominantly in the mix. This might be a personal preference thing; I tend to like my dance music with far greater emphasis on the groove driven by instrumentation, especially the bass line. That’s where we get to one of my main issues with Beyoncé. She’s obviously an incredible vocalist and presence, but she can be overpowering at times, which is problematic when I generally like my disco music to be tight, or at least to give some room for the instrumentation to breathe. To be fair, I think that this issue mainly occurs in the verses. I like the chorus and love the the post-chorus, which features Beyoncé on an incredible melody while while giving the instrumentation plenty of room to shine. And then let’s be honest, none of my criticism actually matters on the dance floor which is where this song actually belongs. **7/10** then.

# #28: “Just Wanna Rock” - Lil Uzi Vert

---

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UhbixyxgsiU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UhbixyxgsiU)

Of all the songs I have listened too so far, I think this one might be the most limited in the context of where it could be consumed. The song is too fragmented, too garage even to be suited to sit down listening. But in the club, the pumped up Jersey Club beat and Lil Uzi Vert acting more hype man than rapper would be more than enough to get anyone going. This makes the song quite hard to rate; I think it’s way too one-dimensional and abbreviated to be properly good. Furthermore, there are many other great club or dance tracks which take the extra step to serve the audience in different listening contexts. However, I think this works precisely for what it is so **6/10** I guess.

# #27: “Karma” - Taylor Swift feat. Ice Spice

---

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzOvgu3GPwY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzOvgu3GPwY)

If you were to ask me what my least favourite songs on “Midnights” are, I would probably tell you “Bejeweled” and “Karma”. It’s funny since those two represent probably some of the more glittery, pop leaning songs on that album. I think the problem might just be that I’ve always found Taylor Swift most interesting when she isn’t singing about how great Taylor Swift is. I also didn’t think their sound fit into the album which I always found was at its best when it embraced that sleepless midnight vibe the title suggested. Colour me disappointed then that this was the third single off the album instead of a song like “Maroon”. I guess I understand; “Karma” is one of the most pop friendly songs on the album and I don’t think the original is bad at all. So why is Ice Spice here to make everything worse? While I’ve come around on her, the fact still remains that she is a limited performer whose strength is looking cool and bringing us all along for the ride. Ice Spice’s verse on “Karma” showcases none of her strengths and all of her weaknesses. Her monotone and the unusually lazy flow make her sound bored in a totally uncool way. Her lyrics are also uninspired; there’s none of the flair that makes her fun in her other tracks. It’s not just Ice Spice’s verse; her ad-libs and occasional vocals accompanying Taylor come across as bad karaoke where you’ve forgotten half the lyrics. I’m sorry that this review is basically all about Ice Spice. If I were talking about the original, I would be far harsher on Taylor. But at least the original was fine. This is actively not good, **4/10**.

# #26: “Ella Baila Sola” - Eslabon Armado X Peso Pluma

---

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZiaYpD9ZrI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZiaYpD9ZrI)

This is the biggest Regional Mexican song on this list, being a top five hit in the US, the first Regional Mexican song to every achieve that. So I guess I was coming in with at least some expectations… oh why have the flatulent horns returned. This song actually has a fairly interesting structure for such a big hit; two extended verses with a spoken interlude in between. I guess people must have found those verses pretty catchy and to be fair, I think the melody is solid. Having said that, I don’t think either of our performers is anything to write home about. I’ve already commented on how I don’t like Peso Pluma’s voice, and the other guy doesn’t really provide much in terms of raw ability either. But mostly it’s those horns, **4/10**.

# #25: “All My Life” - Lil Durk feat. J. Cole

---

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4N8lzKNfy4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4N8lzKNfy4)

It’s a tried and tested strategy. If you’re a rapper looking for a hit, you need to attract that crossover audience. You need to go pop. Of course, not all rappers can do that, so if you’re Lil Durk, you go for the next best option. A children’s choir. “All My Life” is an aspirational song, trying to tell others how anyone can get over systemic oppression and leave the bad times in the past. It’s also really lame. I don’t want to rain on Lil Durk and J. Cole genuinely trying to be uplifting too much, but man do I hate children’s choirs. I think they just sound annoying. I mean I get the usage of the choir for this song. Lil Durk is trying to be aspirational, and from what I’ve read, he has a children’s charity of his own. He clearly cares about them a lot and wants to include them in his message. Our rappers provide some decent lyrics as well. Lil Durk comments more on systemic issues. Meanwhile, J.Cole lays into the culture that exploits the too early death of hip-hop artists, and hopes for a future where his friends can leave the danger of the streets while still being able to support their families. To be clear I like the aspirational nature of this song, I just don’t think this is an enjoyable enough listen to justify the song. If there’s someone to blame, it would have to be producer Dr. Luke, who really does want that award for producer who succeeds by doing the least. It’s just a piano line and a trap beat. Combined with the choir, it all blends together into one lame mess. I’ll say **5/10** since I don’t want to hate on the intentions too much.

# #24: “Sure Thing” - Miguel

---

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4GJVOMjCC4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4GJVOMjCC4)

This is the other TikTok revival job of the year, and arguably it’s a stranger one than “Bloody Mary”. While that song was a deep cut from “Born This Way” and became popular because of a tie in with a popular television series, this song was already a hit in 2011, being the 92nd biggest song on that year’s Billboard Year-End 100. Onto the song and it’s fine. Miguel does the thing where you compare your relationship to your partner to a bunch of things that go together. The production i extremely dated to the late 2000s/early 2010s but that’s not necessarily a bad thing. I don’t really get why this was revived but it’s not bad, **6/10**.

# #23: “Thank God” - Kane Brown with Katelyn Brown

---

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bLzUmfLckEw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bLzUmfLckEw)

Making music with your partner declaring your undying love for each other has always been a risky proposition. Now I certainly hope the best for Mr and Mrs Brown here, but if something ever happens to their relationship, I will be the first person to point out this song and laugh. One of the main issues with these types of songs is how hard the singers often try to convince you of their love, only to expose the cracks in the relationship. Now, I’m not saying that these two are in an unhappy relationship, but maybe giving God credit for giving you each other might be giving not enough credit to each other. Seriously, why are they thanking God for loving each other when they didn’t have to instead of, you know, each other for recognising something they liked and giving each other a part of themselves. The general vagueness of the lyrics mean that there’s not much in the way of chemistry, even between a married couple, though I guess they both sound good. The harmonising at the end is basically the only highlight of the song. The instrumentation and production is also as generic as you would expect, consisting of some pretty basic guitar that doesn’t do anything to keep you interested. Then there’s the weirdest part of the song, the fact that there is just a random extended cymbal hit at the start of the second and third chorus. I was so confused I thought something was wrong with my headphones when I heard that. This is a boring love ballad made worse by some strange decisions, **3/10**.

# #22: “Thought You Should Know” - Morgan Wallen

---

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dw9VmOLwxoM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dw9VmOLwxoM)

Going through all these Morgan Wallen songs has been quite interesting when looking at what he has to say in his music. He reflects on substance abuse and they way that affects his relationships. His entire tone tends to be quite sour. This song is quite different in how heartfelt it is, being a tribute to his mother and how her prayers have come through to help him turn around his life. Now I criticised our previous song for the way it invoked religion but I don’t mind it as much here, since a constant theme of this song is Wallen’s absence from home because of his busy life as a musician. In this case, I do understand the use of religion as a substitute for real physical connection. I think what I like most about this song is how genuine it feels. Maybe it’s just because Wallen always talks about his past mistakes but in this track, it does come through to me, making his acknowledgement of his mother’s role in raising him as someone capable of change feel much more genuine. I think the main issue keeping this song from being great is, say it with me again, detail. The song is more an acknowledgement of his mum, rather than a look at what she’s done. I think this song probably works best for those who live far from home, where the lyrics asking about how things are going would make the most impact. It’s still pretty good, **7/10**.

# #21: “Favorite Song” - Toosii

---

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4D89Qr5vH6U](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4D89Qr5vH6U)

If you’re going to name your song “Favorite Song”, you better back that title up. Any presumption that what I am listening to is going to become my favourite song better be backed up by an all time banger. Unfortunately, an all time banger this is not. In this song, Toosii sings to a woman who has closed her heart off from him, appealing to her to allow him to treat her well. I suppose that if the listener is supposed to be looking at the song from the point of view of the woman, they’re supposed to feel comforted by Toosii, allowing him to capture their heart. Problem is, Toosii would struggle to capture a Lvl. 2 Bidoof, much less the heart of a woman. His voice is so unappealing I imagine any woman hearing it would 180 their way back out of the door before he could do anything. In the chorus, Toosii sings about singing this woman’s favourite song to a crowd where she cannot be found. I don’t blame her. Toosii certainly doesn’t sing my favourite song, but he’s not the only vocalist here. The intro and outro is a sample from another song. Maybe that could become my favourite song. Sadly, Toosii strips the sample of any dignity it may have had in the first place by putting a chipmunk vocal effect over it. Imagine book-ending a song titled “Favorite Song” with a chipmunk sample, **2/10**.

# #20: “Boy’s a liar Pt 2.” - PinkPantheress & Ice Spice

---

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oftolPu9qp4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oftolPu9qp4)

I find it so interesting that Ice Spice appears on this list four times, but not once as a solo artist. I honestly don’t know what this says about Ice Spice. Do people not like her solo work? Is Ice Spice so big a name that everyone wants her on their track for the boost? Maybe it’s because Ice Spice is best in small doses, to provide a rap verse to help extend the song a bit and introduce some fresh ideas. This is what she does here; unlike some of her verses on other entries, this feels like a song that suits Ice Spice’s strengths far more, allowing her to casually tell a boy to fuck off. This is a song that really demands lightness, with both girls understanding that this boy was never worth the effort over the bouncy beat and earworm synth melody. That lightness is definitely what makes this song work; it’s a song where the listener isn’t meant to think too much, where they should just vibe along with the performers. This is fun for what it is, **7/10**.

# #19: “Thinkin’ Bout Me” - Morgan Wallen

---

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DCdL1zdpdM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DCdL1zdpdM)

Now this was a miserable listening experience. So Morgan Wallen really wants to tell us that his ex is definitely not over him. This entire song is just him addressing this ex, asking her if she sees him in the things she does with her present partner. But what’s the point of this entire operation Morgan? Are you trying to get her back. Are you trying to be vindictive to ruin her current relationship? Are you just being an asshole to this woman? I still have no clue what she did to you. The production does not help the overall mood of the song. It’s so minor key and not in any interesting melancholic way; but more in the bitter, I don’t want anything to do with this way. I haven’t even mentioned the trap percussion yet. This isn’t any good, **2/10**.

# #18: “Cruel Summer” - Taylor Swift

---

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ic8j13piAhQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ic8j13piAhQ)

2023 was the year the Swifties won. From the continued success of “Midnights” to the massive release of “1989 (Taylor’s Version)”, it seemed that everything Taylor released was lapped up by her legion of fans. However, their crowning achievement wasn’t any of those. It was “Cruel Summer” . It’s often said that Taylor Swift’s choice of single is questionable and this was most evident on her 2019 album “Lover”, which lead off with “ME!” and followed up with “You Need To Calm Down”, both among the weakest in her discography in my opinion. For years, “Cruel Summer” lay in the deep cuts as a fan favourite. One of those songs where if you knew, you knew. What changed things was the Eras Tour. “Cruel Summer” found popularity as a member of the set list and was unstoppable from there, climbing all the way to number one in the US. As I write this review on 10th December 2023, it’s still in the top ten. It’s winter in the US.

Now onto the song, of course I think it’s amazing, it’s “Cruel Summer” by Taylor Swift. I love how well the lyrics of the song captures Taylor head over heels falling in love, the cruel summer encapsulating her complicated feelings about events surrounding her public life. Apparently, this song is about Joe Alwyn, making the timing of this song’s popularity all the more fascinating. The production is also excellent. The synths and percussion just pop and help build into the huge chorus. Then there’s the bridge. Taylor Swift is known for her bridges and this is regarded by many as one of her best. It’s so good that she just repeats it for the outro. I love in particular how distinctly Taylor it is, especially when she just yells out “I love you, ain’t that the worst thing you ever heard?”. As much as I love this song, there’s two things keeping it from perfection. The first is simply that Taylor is so good an artist she has better songs. The second is that there’s already a [perfect “Cruel Summer”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9ml3nyww80) that does a better job viewing summer with a different lens. I mean it’s still a **9/10**.

# #17: “Under The Influence” - Chris Brown

---

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfxyk1glEq4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfxyk1glEq4)

From one deep cut on a 2019 album that blew up this year to another. Unfortunately, this time it’s a Chris Brown song. Why are we still giving this guy a career again? Also forget what I said in the “Sure Thing” section where I said that would be last TikTok revival job. This also blew up on TikTok, definitive proof that we should just shut down that app and forget it ever existed. Well if Chris Brown is still going to be a thing, might as well give us some good music… and nope. This is pretty bad. The song is about Chris Brown having a sexual encounter with a woman whilst under the influence of drugs. I guess Chris Brown does a decent impression of someone sedated by drugs as he slurs his way throughout the entire song. That doesn’t actually improve the quality of the track though, it just makes me sleepy. The production doesn’t help matters as it sounds leaden. Again, simulating the experience of being sedated by drugs does not necessarily induce an enjoyable listening experience. The only people who could get something out of this are anaesthetists, **3/10**. 

# #16: “Rock and A Hard Place” - Bailey Zimmerman

---

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyapQFCHUlg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyapQFCHUlg)

This is actually one of those songs that appeared on the 2022 year-end list. Clearly, Bailey Zimmerman has to be doing something right to land such a big hit. This song is about the choice between staying and leaving in a troubled relationship. I think Bailey Zimmerman is pretty convincing in his role; he’s a strong vocalist and has the range to convey the exhaustion and frustration depicted in the lyrics. Combined with the fact that this sounds pretty good makes for a **7/10**.

# #15: “As It Was” - Harry Styles

---

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H5v3kku4y6Q](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H5v3kku4y6Q)

You see, this is exactly what I mean by songs crossing over years feeling redundant, because do we really need to talk more about “As It Was” by Harry Styles. Of course I love it. Combine that synth line with Harry Style’s lyrics depicting loneliness and nostalgia over surprisingly spacious production and you get what is one of my most listened to pop songs of the last two years. I guess overplay has begun to set it, but that’s not enough to bring it down, **10/10**.

# #14: “Rich Flex” - Drake & 21 Savage

---

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4DjHHVHWAE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4DjHHVHWAE)

If I had to name a least valuable artist on this list so far, It would surely have to be Drake, who has been the worst part of each (at best mediocre) song he has appeared on. To be fair, Drake has the best part of this song with the “21 can you do somethin’ for me” hook. He also has comfortably the worst part of the song with his verse, where he tries to sound threatening I think, but doesn’t achieve much apart from bore me. Like with “Spin Bout U”, 21 Savage is just better than Drake. His vocal tone and delivery actually makes him sound cool, and the vocal sample in the background gives a menacing aura to the song. I don’t get why Drake keeps trying to do these multi-part songs. Maybe it’s because they make him look like more of an artist than he actually is. There’s nothing wrong with just giving us a good hook and actually playing it more than once Drake. **4/10**.

# #13: “Something in the Orange” - Zach Bryan

---

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bnO0RwkNvWQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bnO0RwkNvWQ)

Yet another song that was on the 2022 year-end list (interesting how most of them are appearing so high up). This is basically the template for “I Remember Everything”’s success, with Zach Bryan pleading to his partner to not leave him, even as he understands deep down that she doesn’t feel the same way about him as he does her. Bryan’s vivid lyricism and the spare, yet propulsive instrumental work fantastically together to paint this picture of this man in denial and sorrow. The only reason this isn’t as good as “I Remember Everything” is because Kacey Musgraves isn’t on it, **9/10**. 

# #12: “You Proof” - Morgan Wallen

---

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CkLMG5NwUg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CkLMG5NwUg)

Guess what… another song on last year’s list. Thank God that gives me an excuse to keep this abbreviated because I’ve seriously run out of things to say about Morgan Wallen. This is yet another song where he leans into substance abuse to get his mind off his ex. I still don’t know what she did to him; is it that hard to provide a little bit of detail Morgan? The chorus is also pretty bad, with the skittering percussion and annoying guitar(?) that signifies its exit. Then there’s the outro, combining bad production and backing vocals into a headache inducing mess. **2/10**.

# #11: “Unholy” - Sam Smith & Kim Petras

---

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9gPaIzbe8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9gPaIzbe8)

Onto yet another re-entry from last year’s list; I promise this is the last one. And hey, it’s one that the non-Americans will know. It’s probably good that I’m making this a shorter review because otherwise I fear I might be participating in a hate crime because this is terrible. It feels like everything here was designed to annoy me, from the way the choir backup vocals accompany Sam Smith to Kim Petras’ ear piercing vocals to the fact that the entire maximalist production throws any subtlety out the window though to be fair, I guess that is the appeal for some people. I won’t get too much into the lyrics since that doesn’t matter, though I will say that they are painfully uninteresting considering the promised title of the song. The bass line is the one saving grace, **2/10**.

# #10: “I’m Good (Blue)” - David Guetta & Bebe Rexha

---

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90RLzVUuXe4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90RLzVUuXe4)

Well I promised you that there was an even more egregious sample coming up. I would like to apologise to any song on this list that I have accused of laziness, because this is *lazy*. Here, David Guetta plays the iconic piano line from “Blue (Da Ba Dee)” and adds a few EDM synths here and there, all while Bebe Rexha shits out the sort of lyrics you would come up with when making fun of party music. But this is played straight down the middle. I’m supposed to enjoy this at the music festival. How could I do that? That would require me to embarrass myself by getting down to fucking Eiffel 65. I guess in a vacuum, this isn’t the absolute worst thing I have ever heard, but the fact that this became popular despite having the artistic merit of a Minecraft parody insults me to the very core of my soul, **2/10**. One more thing. YouTube recommended me [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBGtzfK5Bak) after listening to this song. That is the only reason why this isn’t a 1/10.

# #9: “Snooze” - SZA

---

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDY_XyxBu8A](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDY_XyxBu8A)

This will get way more obvious later, but I’m getting some serious yandere vibes from SZA’s music. “Nobody Gets Me” looked at SZA using sex as a coping mechanism to get over her break-up with someone she felt a special connection to. In “Snooze”, some darker undercurrents begin to seep through into her music. On the surface level, “Snooze” is just an RnB balled about finding comfort in the arms of a lover, with SZA emphasising how she needs to spend every moment with them. The instrumentation complements that theme nicely, making me feel as relaxed as I imagine SZA would when with her partner. The song would already be great with just this, but it’s taken to the next level by the way SZA intertwines her jealousy into the story. In the first verse, she sings about how she would kill her partner’s exes to ensure she alone can have him. In the second verse, she hints at arguments, potentially fuelled by her jealousy and again uses sex as a way to side-step the issue while drawing comparisons to Scarface. I think the underlying tension in the song provides a different dimension to how SZA needs comfort, showing her desperation and increasing need for assurance that her partner really does love her. This is fantastic, it’s a **10/10**.

# #8: “Fast Car” - Luke Combs

---

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXmmyuIqZyo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXmmyuIqZyo)

I want to say this is our first and only cover on the list… wait “Wild as Her” was a cover, but let’s be honest, you didn’t know that. This is the first cover of a song that you actually know and what a song to cover. Tracy Chapman’s “Fast Car” is an all timer of an escapist anthem, only made better by the subtext of being written and performed by a black, queer woman. Luke Combs’ version obviously does not have that subtext but that doesn’t mean his version isn’t great in itself. Luke Combs’ version is played as a countrified tribute to the original, with him not changing the gender of the character in the lyrics. His version soars higher than Chapman’s and feels perhaps more fitting for an arena rock setting, substituting intimacy for power. Going through Luke Combs’ songs for this list, his clear strength has been the way he projects warmth and comfort with his voice, something which suits the song well. It’s not as good as the original, but it never was going to be so **8/10**.

# #7: “Die For You” - The Weeknd & Ariana Grande

---

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQ-qToZUybM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQ-qToZUybM)

The thing that makes TikTok necromancy so confusing is how random it is. So far on this list, we have seen it revive an underappreciated Lady Gaga deep cut, an old Miguel song that already had its time in the sun, and worst of all a Chris Brown song that wasn’t good enough for our ears four years ago. So now we move onto “Die For You”, a song from The Weeknd’s 2016 album “Starboy” where it was the album’s 6th single, but never popular enough to actually end up on a year-end list. That of course, was until last year, when thanks to TikTok and then an Ariana Grande remix, the song managed to become a number one hit in the US. My question has to be why; what element of this song is so good that it needed to be revived and sent to number one? I don’t hear it. The song is slow and lumbering and the lyrics are unremarkable. I assume people really like the combination of The Weeknd and Ariana Grande, which worked fantastically on “Save Your Tears”. This trick clearly does not work twice as the duet feels redundant; I don’t think there is anything said in Ariana’s verse that is interesting. This is more confusing than bad. Why can’t we give the spotlight to those who haven’t experienced it? **5/10**.

# #6: “Calm Down” - Rema & Selena Gomez

---

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcIcVapfqXw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcIcVapfqXw)

Just as we almost finish up this list, we get one more genre that I will sound like an idiot talking about, Afrobeats. Thankfully, I have the feeling that this doesn’t require the deepest insight, since it’s pretty clear that this draws enough from pop to reach that crossover audience. I think that’s probably one of this song’s strengths, providing a combination of familiarity and more exotic taste. The track is fun and bouncy thanks to the bleepy synths and Afrobeats percussion. Both Rema and Selena Gomez have strong command of the melody, which will get stuck in your head quickly if you’re not careful. Arguably most importantly, the two have chemistry. Rema plays the starry-eyed lover, wracked with concern that his feelings aren’t being reciprocated by a girl he likes. His tension builds up through his verse, before being released when Selena Gomez comes in to reassure him, telling him that she’s more than willing to reciprocate his feelings. As I have gone over previously, what makes duets work is believability and balance. This song achieves both, with their interplay building tension, relaxation and intimacy as the song flows. This was a nice listen, **8/10**.

# #5: “Creepin’” - Metro Boomin’, The Weeknd & 21 Savage

---

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYsr8v1jMHI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYsr8v1jMHI)

Turns out I was not only wrong about “Fast Car” being the first cover on the list; it’s also not the last one. To be fair, this isn’t exactly a straight cover of “I Don’t Wanna Know” by Mario Winans; sure The Weeknd takes the verses and chorus from that song, but there’s also an additional rap verse from 21 Savage. As a cover, I don’t think this is as good as “Fast Car”, although that might just be because they’re covering a far worse song. In fact, after listening to that original, I think they might have actually improved on it. Metro Boomin’s production creates a haunted, paranoid atmosphere for The Weeknd to do his thing over. The song feels like it has more momentum than the original. 21 Savage’s guest verse isn’t special; I’ve heard better and worse from his in this list, but it doesn’t really detract from the song. I don’t mind this song, **6/10**.

# #4: “Anti-Hero” - Taylor Swift

---

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1kbLwvqugk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1kbLwvqugk)

In retrospect, “Reputation”, Taylor Swift’s 2017 album might be the most interesting in her discography, not just in terms of content but also in the way the public and her fans have responded. While Taylor was always willing to play into her public persona as a serial dater, songs like “Blank Space” were mostly tongue in cheek, poking fun at her characterisation in the media. “Reputation” felt like the first time where Taylor became more defensive about her persona, famously killing off the old Taylor Swift in “Look What You Made Me Do”. It also made for a very mixed listen. In my opinion, “Reputation” contains Taylor Swift’s worst singles, painful to listen to and with lyrics that elicit a response of “so what?” Despite this, I see quite a lot of people defending “Reputation” nowadays. I don’t see why when “Anti-Hero” is right there to serve as an example of how a popstar can use their music to reshape their image.

I think the key difference between “Anti-Hero” and a song like “Look What You Made Me Do” is acceptance. Here, Taylor Swift realises that the only way to change her image is by embracing it, compared to the defensiveness of biting back at her haters. It also makes for a more relatable listen, one that feels like it can be about anyone and not just Taylor Swift. As I said with “Lavender Haze”, “Midnights” is best when it embraces that insomniac vibe and “Anti-Hero” has to be the shining example of that on the album. Taylor sings about so many of the insecurities that keep her up, detailing how her depression causes her to ignore her friends, and how she has anxiety that her loved ones will leave her, and how she feels self-conscious about her body. It’s not only the lyrics, the entire sound of the song somehow feels so reminiscent of the those moments your anxieties keep you from sleep. The chorus caps of this theme of insecurity brilliantly; Taylor acknowledges how in the past, her inability to see past her own faults is what lead her here. She realises that she hasn’t always been in the right, she has to be an anti-hero in her own story. There are many amazing Taylor Swift songs, but this one’s probably the most personal to me. Whether it’s may favourite from her discography depends on the day, but it’s always a **10/10** no matter what.

# #3: “Kill Bill” - SZA

---

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSRcC626prw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSRcC626prw)

“Kill Bill” picks up from where we last saw SZA on “Snooze” hinting at violence and dives headfirst into her yandere arc. Whereas “Snooze” used those threats as an insight into SZA’s mind pre break-up, “Kill Bill” is firmly in post break-up territory as she contemplates killing her ex so that no one else can have him. The key thing that makes the song work is SZA’s delivery. The lyrics are playful and tongue in cheek; she needs to tell herself that she’s mature even though she’s obviously not over this guy; she delivers the line “I still love him though” with the sincerity of a child telling his mum that he loves her. It’s a fantasy, something that SZA won’t every carry out (I hope), but it is something she has thought of in the depths of her loneliness. This is also just a really good pop song. The hook is inspired and the guitar line that goes through the chorus is super underappreciated. SZA’s probably been the MVP of this list, **9/10**.

# #2: “Flowers” - Miley Cyrus

---

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G7KNmW9a75Y](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G7KNmW9a75Y)

I really liked Miley Cyrus’ 2020 album “Plastic Hearts”. The songs were bangers and I felt the rock-focused sound suited her voice extremely well, calling back to 80s stars like Stevie Nicks. I don’t know if her album from this year, “Endless Summer Vacation” is any good. I haven’t listened to it because I wasn’t interested as soon as I heard the lead single “Flowers”. This is a frustrating one. I don’t think anything on this track is necessarily bad. I still like Miley’s voice. There’s a funky disco groove underlying the song. The lyrical content works, with Miley asserting to everyone (and maybe most importantly herself) that she can achieve happiness without her ex-husband Liam Hemsworth. The thing is, why do I feel nothing listening to this song? That groove is fine, but it doesn’t make me move. The lyrical content should be uplifting, but I just shrug and move on. Maybe it’s because I’ve heard this done better from Miley on “Slide Away”. Maybe it’s because the song feels so sandpapered of any imperfections that it becomes unremarkable. Whatever it may be, it’s a **5/10**.

# #1: “Last Night” - Morgan Wallen

---

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyjgBxIVmEc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyjgBxIVmEc)

Man I hope our number one is a great song worthy of that top spot. Nope! It’s another dour Morgan Wallen tune. Try to guess what the song’s about. Here’s a hint, it’s literally the same content as with all his other songs. Substance abuse, a toxic relationship, telling a girl that she should stay with him, all the classics. Of course the instrumentation is dull as bricks as well. That guitar melody is so limp and by the end of the song, everything just feels like an indistinguishable mush. This doesn’t even do enough for me to call it bad, **4/10**. What a disappointing ending.

# Conclusion

---

We’re done… wow. I’m writing this now on the 12th December 2023, over two weeks after I began this project. I think I’ll just start by leaving some general thoughts on the project. This was an immensely rewarding experience, even as I made my way through a mixed bag of quality, mediocrity and absolute garbage. I really enjoyed the process of actually rationalising my thoughts about music, even if in many cases I felt like I didn’t have enough to talk about. I think that aspect of reviewing is one of the biggest things I could improve on. I complained a lot about detail in my reviews, which is sometimes ironic as I felt like there were times I just couldn’t think of enough to say about a song. There are so many other things I could improve on in future writings. For example, I probably am a bit too repetitive in my language, probably owing to the fact I don’t read as much as I should. Having said that, I certainly believe that I’ve made some improvements. As I said, I enjoyed rationalising my thoughts about music, and I think I only got better at it as I wrote more, specifically when looking at themes and tone within the songs. While I could go back and rewrite some of the older reviews, I think it’s more interesting to leave things as is. It means there’s a record of my progression, and it shows my honest first impressions. Also I desperately need to do something else with my life right now so there’s that.

Moving onto the music, I was pleasantly surprised. I came in with the impression that this was a pretty dire year for popular music and sure it wasn’t great, but there were many gems in there. Cutting songs for the top 10 best list was painful. The final average score was 5.67/10. I might come back and do some data analysis. We will see. One of the main goals was pushing my musical boundaries. In this list, I listened to pop, country, RnB, hip-hop, Regional Mexican, reggaeton and maybe more that I’m missing. While my favourite songs are dominated by the pop artists, I feel like a learnt a lot about these other genres in how they express their ideas as well as the vibes different genres go for. As for individual artists, shout out to SZA and Luke Combs. I think they were the most consistent artists with multiple hits. The worst artist on the list with multiple hits was comfortably Drake. Didn’t this guy used to be good?

Finally I just want to reflect on some reviews I’m especially proud of. For best reviews, I’m really proud of my 10/10 reviews for “I Remember Everything” and “Escapism”; I feel like they’re my best examples of encapsulating what I love about music. On the converse, I put in a lot of effort into my reviews for the two conservative songs “Rich Men North of Richmond” and “Try That In A Small Town”. It’s certainly not the best political commentary you’ll see but I’m proud of the way I honestly gave my thoughts about larger systemic issues. Onto a lighter topic, the funnies. For my best jokes, I think the Minecraft joke in “What It Is (Block Boy)” was very stupid in a good way. I hope I was also able to accurate capture the mental breakdown I had listening to “Holly Jolly Christmas”. The Jordan Davis saga contains two one liners I am unreasonably proud of. Finally, I think my review of “Favorite Song” might be the best of the lot.

Uh, If you read all that, thanks. This conclusion was more for my benefit than anyone else’s so I wouldn’t have blamed you if you’d already left. Hopefully, in the future I will be doing more of this. Bye.
